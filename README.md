# Sawcce's GitHub

__Hi ! I'm Sawcce, a french developer (and student)__  

Currently studying Maths, Physics and Industrial Engineering in TSI.

<br />

I love to experiment with new stuff! Mostly working on my [website](https://sawcce.com) in my spare time (website that I have made many iterations of).
"Obsessed" with esolangs and programming languages creation (my project meep^2 is on hold but I plan on
coming back to it when I have more time). Also very interested in OSDev and networking.
Some experience with game development in Unity.

A huge fan of functional programming and I enjoy programming in Haskell and Elixir a lot.
Rust is also one of my favorites although less efficient for fast iteration and prtotyping.

I have been using Javascript and Typescript for a very long time, languages that I love using despite
their quirks. Along with that I have used React for multiple years, and I enjoy NextJS and Expo
for fullstack development. CI/CD with Vercel is a must.

<br />

I mainly use React and Next for web dev, I have had some experience with Nuxt and SvelteKit but I have not used them in
a long while. (I have experimented with Laravel + Inertia too).

<br/>

I use Doom Emacs, NeoVim and VSCode as my code editors! (also Android Studio and Intellij Idea occasionally)

Currently coding on:
- Windows
- ArchLinux (Hyprland)
