# Sawcce's GitHub

__Hi ! I'm Sawcce, a french developer (and student)__  

Currently studying Maths, Physics and Industrial Engineering in TSI.

<br />

I love to experiment with new stuff! Mostly working on my [website](https://sawcce.com) in my spare time.
"Obsessed" with esolangs and programming language creations (my project meep^2 is on hold but I plan on
coming back to it when I have more time). Also very interested in OSDev and networking.
Some experience with game development in Unity.

A huge fan of functional programming and I enjoy programming in Haskell and Elixir a lot.
Rust is also one of my favorites although less efficient for fast iteration and prtotyping.

I have been using Javascript and Typescript for a very long time, languages that I love using despite
their quirks. Along with that I have used React for multiple years, and I enjoy NextJS and Expo
for fullstack development. CI/CD with vercel is a must.

<br />

The following stats are mostly wrong as a lot of my commits happen on private repos!
